## Overview

This repository contains the design and documentation for the Sensing Subsystem of a micro-mouse robot. The Sensing Subsystem serves as the "eyes" of the robot, providing information to the processor to detect obstacles in its environment.

## Contents

KiCad version designs: "v2.zip", "v3.zip", "v4.zip"

Software Integration: Code "final.zip" for integrating the sensing module with the microcontroller.

Images: Contains 2D/3D renderings, PCB layouts, and images of hardware for the sensing module.

JLCPCB Order Information: BOM (Bill of Materials) for ist of components required for building the sensing module, and acceptance page for order.
