## Overview

This repository contains the design and documentation for the Sensing Subsystem of a micro-mouse robot. The Sensing Subsystem serves as the "eyes" of the robot, providing information to the processor to detect obstacles in its environment.

## Contents

    Hardware Design: Contains schematics, PCB layouts, and component datasheets for the sensing module.
    Software Integration: Guides and code snippets for integrating the sensing module with the microcontroller.
    Testing Documentation: Procedures and results for testing the functionality of the sensing subsystem.
    Specifications: Detailed specifications and requirements for the sensing subsystem.
    BOM (Bill of Materials): List of components required for building the sensing module.
